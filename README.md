# smarty-js

A set of handy JavaScript functions, gists selected by me, driven by the community :)

## Contribution

1. clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/jim-y/smarty-js.git`
2. append your gist to the proper place (file)
3. annotate your gist with your id (`@author`) and add a description (`@description`)

## Rules

There are a few rules to follow to make the repo consistent.

* If you are contributing, always add [jsDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) to your gist, the following annotations and fields are mandatory
  1. tell the community in a few words, what your gist could be used for.
  2.  `@author` - your username (GitHub/Twitter, whatever you want)
* If you are willing to give a better alternative to an existing gist, refactor the gist, that is, create a separate `.js` file in the current directory with the name of the gist (usually the function name), and copy over the **preceding** gist, and **yours** too. Don't forget to write down in the description, why your solution is better than the other.
  * _Sample_: i want to refactor `arrays.js#populate`, so instead of adding the same function to `arrays.js` i would create a(n) `arrays/populate.js` file where i would add the original function, and my refactored one with a description and the needed jsDoc.
* Create short, easy to understand (or at least well documented :trollface:) gists.
* Try to place it into the right folder.

Thats it, let's collaborate ^^
